									<h1>Career Related Education</h1>
									<p>Activity Involvement at Cupertino High School</p>
								</header>
		<!--						<div class="image main"><img src="images/pic01.jpg" alt="" /></div> -->
								<p>Over my last 3.5 years as a Cupertino High School Student I have been involved within numerous extracurricular clubs and teams, however, these are the activities that allowed me to develop fundamental industry skills, giving me an edge against other prospective quants. </p>
								<ul>
										<h3><li>Cupertino Future Business Leaders of America </li></h3>
										<ul>
											<li><b> Competitive Record </b></li>
<div class="image right"><img src="images/fblapic.jpg" alt="" /></div>
												<ul>
														<li> By competing up to the national level for Cupertino FBLA, I have been able to learn and practice many skills most quantitative analysts sustain.
														<li> As a Personal Finance competitor, I studied and practiced financial theories, stock market trends, and financial mathematics problems, developing necessary quantitative financial knowledge.
														<li> As an Organizational Leadership competitor, I practiced and mastered the art of business management, through both the corporate and personal level, all while developing fundamental leadership traits to lead quant discussions and successfully persuade my clients.
														<li> As a 3D Animation competitor, I was allowed to practice creativity to create financial projection models (as both animation and portfolio development require a creative mindset), and technical development skills. I won 2nd place at SLC 2018 and progressed to NLC in Baltimore, Maryland.
												</li>
												</ul>
											<li><b> American Enterprise Committee Member (2016/2017) </b></li>
											<ul>
													<li> I was able to show my mastery of business management skills by participating as a Sedgwick Elementary School Business Teacher. Every year the Cupertino FBLA Chapter sends members to the local elementary school to act as business mentors to the little kids. I was privileged to be a mentor, helping teach a group of ~18 students fundamental management skills. I also got to see the positive effect of our lessons, as I got to see the students I teach successfully start their own business and sell their items to their fellow classmates at their winter marketplace festival.   </li>
											</ul>
												<li><b> Middle Level Pseudo Bay Section Judge (2016/2017) </b></li>
											<li>I also developed analytical skills as I was a judge for a speaking competition at Pseudo-Bays, an FBLA competition conference for local middle schools. My partner and I kept track of competitor’s speeches and evaluated their knowledge and understanding within seconds.
    </li>

											<li> <b>California FBLA Financial Literacy Award Recipient (2017/2018/2019) </b> </li>
											<ul>
												<li> I worked towards and was awarded the California FBLA Financial Literacy award which highlights my mastery of personal finance. This award spurred my interest in finance, as after receiving this honor, I started to read informative economic news articles and analyze stock market trends daily. </li>
											</ul>
										</ul></ul>
								<ul><h3><li>First Robotics</h3></li>
<div class="image left"><img src="images/svrdrive.jpg" alt="" /></div>
									<ul>
										<li><b> Professional Technical Experience </b></li>
										<ul>
											<li>As an engineer in both the FIRST Tech Challenge and FIRST Robotics Challenge, I have been able to practice my technical quantitative development skills in a more practical sense. Making simulations and sketches to plan robots helps me visualize the process of building a robot the same way a quantitative analyst visualizes creating a financial plan. Utilizing multiple Java APIs and Repositories I have assisted with developing multiple software projects, such as website user interface creation and robot speed and motion detection. To build successful robots, I create mathematical and mechanical models to test the practicality of the mechanism before machining the parts, just as how a quant develops mathematical models to successfully make financial predictions. My expertise in these technical skills is highlighted through the Autonomous Control Award my robotics team received after finding the most innovative way to integrate hardware sensors with self-coded autonomous paths. </li></ul>
										<li><b> Team Leadership Skills</b></li>
										<ul>
											<li>As part of our school's FIRST Robotics Competition 60 member team, I was elected as a Hardware Project Coordinator. As Coordinator, I lead a group of roboticists to build a driver controlling station for our robot. The creation of this station required me to develop various sized models using similar mathematical algorithms to those of quants in the finance industry. As I lead the team, I grew, as major setbacks would start pushing me to find solutions rather than give up, which is crucial in the uncertain world of quantitative analysis. Robotics also allows me to practice how to explain information to various people; as a mentor for FIRST Lego League team Cats Love Mars, I assisted 6 elementary school students in building a Lego Mindstorms robot that won Best Robot Design and Performance awards at their regional tournament. This skill is crucial for quants as you never know what type of person you will need assistance from, but must be able to effectively communicate with them. </li>
										</ul>
										<li><b> Strategic Financing </b></li>
											<ul>
												<div class="image right"><img src="images/heenpic.jpg" alt="" /></div>

												<li>I am part of the Cupertino Robotics Sponsorship team, where I have to come up with strategies to fund the organization's annual 5 figure budget. From calling corporate headquarters to meeting with business owners I try by all means to get funding for our team. This resilience is perfect for any quantitative analyst, as they must also try by all means to create financial projections, even during the worst of market times.</li>
											</ul>
										<li><b>Competitive attitude</b></li>
											<ul>
												<li>Our school’s 60 member FIRST Robotics Competition team has only two drivers, one of them being me. As the lead robot driver, I must cope with all the negative comments I receive from my opponents during tournaments. As it is just me and one other driver, being stared down by the hundreds watching the match in the stadium and the others on the national stream, we must always keep our composure. Just like a quant, because from a lot of experience, I know how to ignore the negativity if something doesn’t work in your favor, and push through to successfully fulfill my task.</li>

										<h3><li>Cupertino Filmmaking</h3></li>
											<ul>
													<li><b>Opportunistic</b></li>
															<ul>
																<li>My inspiration to create the school filmmaking club came from the fact that I saw that there was a need for an organization to videotape school events and activities. I took the opportunity and made it a reality, just like a true quant who also must be aware of what's going on around them and when is the perfect time to implement any plan. </li>
																<div class="image left"><img src="images/recordpic.jpg" alt="" /></div>

															</ul>

													<li><b>Creative Software Development</b></li>
															<ul>
																<li> I develop interactive and innovative ways to teach 25 members on storyboarding, script writing,green screen coding, acting, and editing. Implemented a software algorithm that would allow people to look at the image behind a green screen, and see themselves in the picture. This type of algorithm is also used by quants if they would like to use strategies such as satellite imagery to predict market trends.</li>
															<ul>
													<li><b>Organizational Skills</b></li>
															<ul>
																<li>I helped organize the 2019 Cupertino District-Wide Film Festival by managing and raising funds as a treasurer. Without successful planning this event will not take place, being dependent on my organization and management. This is crucial for quants who almost always more work than they can handle at once, so they must decide how to successfully look through everything.</li>

									<ul><li><h3> Cupertino Assistant Student Body Senate </h3></li>
											<ul>
												<div class="image right"><img src="images/asbpic.jpg" alt="" /></div>

												<li><b>Work Devotion</b></li>
												<ul>
													<li>I represented my Junior Class of 2019 as Student Senator: communicating class ideas, helping plan school-wide events, facilitating school activities, and assisting in the promotion of school projects. This shows how passionate I am towards my school, and any task they would give me. I am also a Cupertino Crew Freshman Mentor who helps the new class of 2023 freshman around their new school. Being passionate in your work is also very important for quantitative analysts as gruesome work hours can only be regulated if you like what you do for that amount of time.</li>

				<h3>Quantitative Development Research Report:</h3>
												<p> My career research project report about Quantitative Development that I conducted in my Principles of Business class. Creating this report in my 10th grade business class highlights my first strides at developing professional experience in the fields of quantitative analysis and development. This research project motivated me to continue pursuing activities relating to a quant, as after conducting this report, I gained a strong attachment towards the innovative career.

												<h3>AP Statistics Bread Analysis Research Project</h3>
												<p>My bread research project allows me to personally dive into the field of quantitative analysis, as I was able to interview and analyze real time data from my high school. From this project, I practiced building a quantitative financial report, as my bread research project is designed the same way a financial plan is laid out in a portfolio.   </p>

			<h2> Quantitative Analyst Relevant Coursework </h2>
				<p> During high school, I chose specific classes to further specialize  my quantitative analysis skills.
 </p>
				<p></p>
				<ul>
					<h3><li>Principles of Business</li></h3>
					<ul>
						<li>This course taught me almost everything there is to know about the field of business. From business management to financial analytics, I have been able to learn about the vast field through many research projects and activities. This class got me interested in Quantitative Analysis after letting me pursue a career research project on it. This class developed my fondness towards business and finance, and taught me most of the management and financial applications all quants must know before joining the industry.</li>
					</ul>
					<h3><li> AP Computer Science A</li></h3>
					<ul>
						<li>This course has given me the opportunity to write computer programs and utilize Java algorithm to create unique projects. I was introduced to quantitative programming methods such as Object Oriented Programming and algorithmic problem solving. These programs are especially useful when quants are analyzing thousands of data points from the stock market, and need a fast way to organize their findings.
 </li>
					</ul>

					<h3><li>AP Statistics</li></h3>
					<ul>
						<li>This class was very important in my journey to become a quantitative analyst because statistics is the most common form of quantitative analytics. From creating stock market prediction models using null hypotheses to finding the best investments by analyzing the normality of stock values, statistics is used during most of a quant’s work.
</li>
					</ul>
					<h3><li>AP Calculus AB</li></h3>
					<ul>
						<li>I learned the fundamentals of integral, differential, and limit calculus; fundamental mathematical theories all quants must utilize while projecting financial models. This class also touched upon the financial application of calculus, through optimization, and allowed me to experience mathematics from a more business perspective.
</li>
					</ul>
					<h3><li>AP Physics C: Mech & AP Physics C: E&M</h3></li>
					<ul>
						<li> These two advanced courses teach the fundamentals of physics, and explain how everything interacts with each other. Through calculus based physics, I create mathematical models for hundreds of lab data points, and gain meaningful education on how to analyze them. It allows me to practice finding peaks and patterns in lots of data, just like quants do with the stock market.</li>
					</ul>
					<h3><li> International Business</h3></li>
					<ul>
						<li>This course allowed me to understand different financial systems across the world. As a quant is not restricted within the United States, this class gave meaningful education about world wide exchanges. My notes document shows my personal research on world-wide affairs of a quantitative analyst.

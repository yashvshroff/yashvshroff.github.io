								<h1>Clinical Experiences<br /></h1>
								<p>As a student pursuing a career in medicine, I have had numerous clinical experiences through shadowing, working at a doctor’s office, and Stanford’s SSTEM program, in addition to my community service activities.
								</p>

							<h2> Shadowing Pediatrician, Internist, and Neurosurgeon </h2>
							<div class="image right"><img src="images/ics.jpg" alt="" /></div>
							<p>
								Shadowing physicians has allowed me to observe a wide variety of medical ailments, diagnoses, and patient-doctor interactions. I shadowed a pediatrician as she performed a circumcision and helped patients with congenital disorders. I observed an internal medicine doctor at an urgent care center as she helped a patient with torn knee ligaments and diagnosed another with lung cancer. I followed an Obstetric Gynecologist as she performed surgery and conducted ultrasounds on her patients. I also had the opportunity to shadow a neurosurgeon as he carefully removed a brain tumor from a patient.

							<h2> Working at an OB/GYN's Clinic </h2>
							<p>
								I worked at a private Obstetrics and Gynecology Medical Office. We offered clinical expertise and compassionate care to our patients and created an environment where women can feel comfortable and secure, knowing that we put our patients' needs first. As an intern, I was responsible for confirming insurance eligibility, scheduling appointments, checking patients in and out of OfficeAlly EHR, recording incoming faxes, printing prescription refills, writing lab orders, updating patients' medical charts/records, measuring patient's blood pressure/weight, reviewing lab results, and cleaning medical equipment. This summer job helped me learn what happens behind the scenes at a doctor's office. I also got HIPPA certified and learned about the documentation requirements and insurance eligibility. In addition to having the opportunity to shadow the OB/GYN, this experience exposed me to a side of medicine that I hadn't experienced before: medical insurance and policies that affect a medical practice.

							<h2> Stanford’s STEM Program </h2>
							<p>
								SCCMA's and Stanford's Transformative Experience in Medicine is a 3-week camp led by Stanford's Medical Students. It introduced me to the different specialties in the field of medicine through guest speakers including primary care physicians, interventional cardiologists, and neurosurgeons. Here, I performed my first dissections of a cow's eye, heart, and brain and even performed my first ultrasound on a pregnant woman. We were also taught how to take patient history/vitals and I had the opportunity to visit their cadaver lab.

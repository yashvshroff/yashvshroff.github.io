								<p>I have been part of Boy Scouts of America for the past 8 years. Every year, I develop into a stronger, more capable, and well-rounded leader for America. I have been honored with the highest possible awards, receiving the rank of Eagle Scout with Silver Eagle Palms and over 35 skill-oriented merit badges, being nominated into the selective National Order of the Arrow, and accumulating over 250 years of community service through hundreds of personal volunteer projects.</p>
								<p>A detailed excerpt of my commitment:</p>
								<p><small> As an Eagle Scout from Troop 443, my 8 years of service is distinguished through making the world more sustainable, being a leader and mentor to others, and being an advocate for communal good. I've led 40 younger scouts and taught them the value of resilience. I've stood out as a vital boy scout in the state of California by creating an everlasting impact to many scouts in my community. Doing so, I was nominated to join the very selective National Order of the Arrow(OA), the Boy Scout leadership honor society for unique boy scouts who demonstrate mastery and excellence in leadership and life fundamentals. Holding the highest rank in my local boy scout troop, I started to take on California State leadership roles. The OA allowed me to collaborate with some of California's most talented leaders as we would plan and host California state-wide scouting events. The responsibility that comes with this title has developed my integrity, appreciation of collaboration, and resilience to help others.

Scouting has given me opportunities to consistently give back to my community, building a foundation for me to express my community-oriented values. I've coupled my scouting and STEM interests to host multiple beneficial community projects - projects ranging from making water sprinklers for a natural reserve to creating a flushable toilet system at Camp High Sierra. These frequent hands-on experiences distinguish my plans to make any environment mutually beneficial for both students and faculty through constant self-driven campus projects and welfare programs.

I knew I did not want my Boy Scout journey to end after achieving the rank of Eagle Scout. I then set out to achieve what only 5% of USA Eagle Scouts and 5 others in my boy scout troop and had received: obtaining all three National Eagle Palms. Staying to pursue these awards highlights my determination towards pursuing the highest task anywhere. Recognizing the value of adherence, that I gained from the Eagle Palms, I wanted others to receive the same opportunity; I mentored two scouts who are now on track to receive this prestigious award by 2019. My dedication to boy scouts has stuck with me. I continue striving to pursue my maximum potential through leadership, mentorship, and consistency, making me a lifelong learner.

<p>My Boy Scouts journey in itself has provided me with the entire skillset every quantitative analyst has, which is why it’s a sample of its own. As a quant requires keen leadership traits, I have demonstrated mastery in leadership management through my service for my local troop and all scouts in California. A quant also has to have advanced competence in the technical mathematics, engineering, and finance which I have shown by specializing in 36 different subjects through merit badges. Here is a list of my <a href="Website/Final - Pranays advancement report.pdf"target="_blank">[Merit Badges].</a></p>

<p>Before becoming an Eagle Scout, I had to give back to my community. To fulfil this, I decided to help out a newly refurbished STEAM Elementary School, who was in desperate need of someone to come up with an effect solution to the school’s deteriorating educational garden. My 200-hour service project to be the first to find a solution to the school’s primary concern led to this:</p>
<p><small> Ever since Central Park STEM Elementary School opened up at the start of 2015, they always struggled with their educational garden. For the school's three years, the squirrels had been digging up the garden in search of delicate crops, and no one knew how to stop them. Mrs. Zeitler- the kindergarten grade teacher and garden supervisor- felt hopeless as many had unsuccessfully tried to keep the squirrels out. </p>
	<p>The innovator inside me knew something could be done. Knowing how annoying it is to lose a garden to squirrels and wanting to give back to my recently renovated local elementary school, I went to work. I threw pieces of wood together and came up with simple sketches. I made constant trips to the school, taking notes of measurements and weather conditions in order to create a full-scale 3D model. I also built 3 small-scale wooden enclosures to test them out in my own backyard. After seeing the backyard enclosures keep squirrels out of my berry bushes over the course of 3 months, I deemed the prototype a success. I rallied a group of volunteers and we installed the 16 feet wide enclosures around each of the school's garden beds.</p>
	<p> My enclosures continue to be a success as they protect the crops and allow for the gardens to serve their educational purpose. The school sustained a full fall harvest, preserving 100% of their crops. This allowed the teachers to finally utilize their fall classroom curriculum, allowing students to witness the science of the gardening cycle through seed growth, plant maturation, and food science. The school was also able to integrate their organic crops for school lunches. This allowed them to reduce their expenditures for lunches, effectively allowing the school to use the saved funds for other essential programs. </p>
	<p>The enclosures revitalized a space that led to the growth of intellectual curiosity for the students. They created an environment that paralleled the possibilities of students learning with the secure growth of the crops. My steadfast belief in the cohesion the enclosures permitted allowed the school to host limitless garden opportunities. </p>
	</small>
	<p>This project in itself highlights my creativity, a trait all quantitative analysts must have. My creative thinking saved the school years of trouble and left a sustainable environment in return. I will use my innovate ideas to spur innovation throughout the industry of quantitative analysis and become the alpha analyst.
Everything I have done as a Boy Scout has only spurred my interest in quantitative analysis and helped me develop fundamental quantitative analysis skills, as shown through my abundant involvement and creative projects.</p>

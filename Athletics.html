							<h1>Athletics<br /></h1>
							<p>After swimming competatively at Santa Clara Swim Club for 10 years and acheiving Junior Olympic and Far Western Times, I joined my school's Varsity Boy's Water Polo and Varsity Swim Teams.

						<h2> Varsity Water Polo </h2>

						</div>
						<p>
							As a member of the Boy's Varsity Water Polo team, I played a crucial role as the "sprinter," where I was in charge of running drive plays and beating the other team to the ball. With my years of swimming experience, I helped my teamates improve their swimming technique and become faster players. Throughout the years, I also improved my hand-eye coordination and became one of the best passers and scorers on the team.

						<h2> Varsity Swim Team </h2>
						<div class="image left"><img src="images/swimming1.jpg" alt="" /></div>
						<p>
							Similair to Water Polo, I used my swimming experience to improve my teamates tehnique in all 4 strokes: butterfly, backstroke, breastroke, and freestyle. I also organized the boy's relay team and qualified/participated in the Central Coast Section Swimming Championship. This year, I am a Varsity Swimming Captain and responsible for leading the whole team in practices and swim meets.

						<h2> What I have learned... </h2>
						<div class="image right"><img src="images/Swim1.jpg" alt="" /></div>
						<p>
							Swimming is not just a sport, it is a race against yourself. Whether I was at Far Westerns or Junior Olympics, winning the 100-yard butterfly and 200-yard individual medley not only meant coming first in the race, but also improving my personal record. Every lap I swim and every stroke I take is an improvement of the last until I perfect it: “pull with my hand fully extended”, “keep my fingers together”, “there we go!”.
							<br>
							Swimming for more than 8,100 hours and over 12,150,000 yards, did not only make me a talented swimmer and a leader in Cupertino High School’s Varsity Water Polo and Swimming team, but also made me a better person. I integrated the traits of dedication and persistence that I gained from swimming in my daily life. For example, when I struggled in Pre-Calculus Honors in the first semester of my freshman year, I knew, just like with swimming, I needed to keep practicing in order to get the scores I wanted. I did all the problems from the book and asked my teacher for more to make sure I had a clear understanding of the chain-rule of derivation and knew the unit circle like the back of my hand. Furthermore, as the President of Medical Explorers, when one Physician was unable to be a guest speaker, I called up 5 more until I was able to find one. In AP Chemistry, I made an appointment to come after school to conduct 4 more paper chromatography trials until I found the best eluent with a percent error less than 0.5%.

							Whether it was winning at a swim meet or perfecting a lab, a month of practice was always worth it and I will keep that spirit alive as I continue pursuing a career in medicine.

									<h1>Education<br /></h1>
									<p>I have been at Cupertino High School for the last 4 years where I have been an active member of the student body, taken challenging courses, and participated in numerous extracurricular activities.
									<br>
									Thus far, my favorite classes include American Literature, AP Chemistry, Spanish 4 Honors, AP Computer Science, and AP Statistics.
									</p>
								</header>
								<h2> AP Chemistry: </h2>
								<div class="image right"><img src="images/chem1.jpg" alt="" /></div>
								<p>
									In AP Chemistry, I especially enjoyed the many different labs that I participated in. Whether it was acting like a detective to uncover the composition of an unknown solution or using professional-grade equipment like spectrophotometers to get precise and accurate data. These labs along with the classes supplemented my understanding of the subject and inspired me to ask more questions and go beyond my textbook to understand the different chemical processes that affected my data. Each week I was excited about the new topics I would learn, new equipment to use, and a new mission for me to take on. I am excited to further explore topics of thermochemistry and organic chemistry as I take more challenging courses in college.
 								</p>

								<h2> Spanish 4 Honors </h2>
								<p>
									Spanish Four Honors was a class period filled with cultural immersion and real-life discussions. While we learned new vocabulary words and verb tenses, my favorite parts were presenting projects on pollution/ global warming, practicing salsa dancing, and detailing the lives of famous Hispanic politicians/celebrities (all in Spanish, of course). I was excited by each activity not only by the chance to practice speaking Spanish, but also because each introduced me to controversial issues and Hispanic cultures in different contexts.
								</p>

								<h2> AP Computer Science </h2>
								<p>
									AP Computer Science may have included many long nights with my computer, but when I saw my program, sort through a data set quickly or display my Pac-man game, it was always worth it. The different projects we worked on were the best part of the class. Each one would either help us solve a real-life problem like calculating taxes and reading barcodes, or help us create our own spider solitaire and text adventure games. I utilized my programming skills further during my summer internship at UCSF, to create an analysis for Alzheimer’s and Autism patients. I also created 3-D computerized head models detailing the parts of the brain used in pitch perturbation trials using MEG and MRI scans. The results of my analysis have shown us how patients often used different parts of the brain and have different responses to a pitch perturbation, which is key to creating specific therapies and treatments for the patients.

								<br>
								<div class="image left"><img src="images/APStats.jpg" alt="" /></div>
								<h2> AP Statistics </h2>
								<p>
									AP Statistics to many is about learning different significance tests, charts, or calculator functions. However, I loved the different research projects we did to analyze different trends among CHS students. In one project, I collected data on the pupillary distance of our classmates, in another I looked at students’ preference between SAT & ACT in conjunction with their interest in science, and in yet another, I analyzed the health insurance plans of CHS students in comparison to that of the US. Each one of these projects required the use of statistics but also allowed me to research ideas and topics I was interested in.
								</p>

								<h2> Americal Literature </h2>
								<p>
									In addition to reading great plays and novels like A Raisin in the Sun by Loraine Hansberry, One Flew over the Cuckoo’s Nest by Ken Kesey, and The Catcher in the Rye by JD Salinger, I enjoyed researching into the background of each story. The mini-projects/presentations I did in class, including analyzing the Harlem renaissance and investigating the treatment of people with mental disabilities in the 1950s allowed me to grasp a better understanding of each author’s comments on society. Furthermore, one of my favorite assignments of the year was the persuasive speech. I appreciated being able to research more on the ethics of gene manipulation and CRISPR/CAS9, a topic of particular interest to me, and sharing my ideas with the class.
									<br>
									Overall, the American Literature class also helped me grow as a reader and writer. I learned to write strong literary analysis essays on classic novels along with unique themes and literary techniques, lead book club meetings with my peers, analyze credible sources and express my ideas in a persuasive speech about bioethics, and discuss the implications of different pieces of literature through Socratic seminars. My parents and friends agree that my writing has improved with the help and feedback of peer review sessions and your guidance. This year, as I continue my writing career through VMC, the techniques I learned have been extremely beneficial in creating a personal speech about me and crafting a narrative essay.

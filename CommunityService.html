								<h1>Community Service<br /></h1>
								<p>Over the last few years, I have spent hundreds of hours volunteering in different settings and with different age groups. All of my volunteering efforts have made me a kinder, caring, and compassionate person.

							<h2> Friends for Philippines (350+ hours) </h2>
							<div class="image right"><img src="images/ics.jpg" alt="" /></div>
							<p>
								For the last 3 summers, I have volunteered on month-long medical mission trips to the Philippines and this past summer, I led 9 other high school students in participating in the mission as well. Before starting our mission, I organized a clothing and canned food drive at school. Partnering with physicians from Stanford, we organized a mobile clinic to help underserved communities that suffer from chronic diseases and also provided nutritious food to the severely malnourished children in the villages.  We also educated them on their ailments and lifestyle changes. While I gained a lot of medical experience from shadowing doctors and taking vitals, seeing a child smile as I gave him a pack of dinosaur multivitamins, encouraging a senior take part in our Zumba exercise class, and even helping a man who lost consciousness from low blood sugar have helped me mature as an individual and become compassionate.
								The fulfillment I achieve from these medical mission trips have kept me going back to the Philippines year after year.

							<h2> El Camino Hospital Medical/Surgical and Orthopedic Department (200+ hours) </h2>
							<p>
								Every other weekend, I volunteer at El Camino Hospital in Los Gatos in their Medical-Surgical and Orthopedic departments. I assist nurses in caring for patients by answering patient bed calls/requests, organizing paperwork, and helping new patients get accustomed to the hospital. Volunteering at El Camino Hospital has also provided me with experiences in a medical setting and helped me improve my communication and organizational skills critical to providing each patient with a warm and pleasant stay at the hospital.

							<h2> Cupertino Healthcare and Wellness Center (100+ hours): </h2>
							<p>
								As the FBLA Community service project chair, I led a committee of 15 CHS students  in organizing volunteering events at Cupertino Healthcare and Wellness Center. While I played games or did arts and crafts with the patients, we talked about the books they had read and places they had been to. Every visit I would learn of a new story of a patient’s experience. I felt rewarded knowing the difference I could make to someone’s life by just listening to their stories. Their reactions have touched me, and changed the way I look at people forever. This experience has made me realize that  the true definition of success is not the grades on my transcript, but helping others who cannot help themselves.

<h3> Career Development Planning </h3>

									<p>Alongside educational high school activities, I have participated in multiple professional development projects outside of my school. Each of these activities has allowed me to develop crucial skills all quants must attain.</p>
								</header>
								<ul>
									<li><b>Simplion Technologies and Lirik Co. Intern</b></li>
										<ul>
											<li> I am very grateful to have the opportunity to work in the professional field of quantitative analysis as a highschooler through internships in the Silicon Valley. As a summer intern for both Simplion and Lirik, which are sister companies, I was able to experience both the management and software development sides of a business, and gained influential experience that I can take with me. I worked as a Financial Analyst for Simplion Technologies, managing and organizing the company’s and the worker’s monthly bank statements. I also was an auditor to 100 of their international clients, learning about the process of financial analysis. I was able to explore the realm of software development by learning about SalesForce Development through Lirik, and participating in their client customer service calls. With my software development experience, I now understand the norm for business software development, and will use my competence to work well in any future quantitative business.
											 </li>
										</ul>
									<li> <b>Job Shadowing Program at Intel</b> </li>
										<ul>
											<div class="image right"><img src="images/intelpic.jpg" alt="" /></div>

											<li> I got the opportunity to job shadow under Intel software developer Mr. Dinyar Dastoor. He showed me the operation of Intel’s chip designing and programming process, and helped me understand important tools all professional quantitative developers use. During this experience, I was able to meet Mrs. Alice Chan, the Intel Vice President of Compilers and Libraries, who gave me more professional development advice. I also got to meet Mrs.Daisy Rincon, an Intel marketing and business development manager, who showed me how a quantitative analyst works in a multinational technology corporation.</li>
										</ul>
									<li><b> Cupertino 3D Prints Business CEO</b></li>
										<ul>
											<li>I decided to partake in my own entrepreneurial adventures by creating a 3d design and modeling company for my city. Through my business, I gained problem solving skills by working through business setbacks. I also attained management skills as I had to keep my business organized for it to remain operational and profitable.
 </li>
											<li>You can read an excerpt on my interest in 3d animation and my business here: <a href="Website/aniessay.pdf"target="_blank">[link]</a></li>
										</ul>

									<li><b>The Tech Challenge Competition</b></li>
									<div class="image left"><img src="images/comppic.jpg" alt="" /></div>

											<ul>
												<li>I participated in the Rock the Ravine tech challenge at the Technological Museum of Innovation. In this competition, my group created a fully functional robot using an arduino chassis. By creating the robot from scratch, I gained insight on strategic planning and development, as it took numerous prototypes before finalizing a functional robot model. Soft coding our robot helped me practice software development skills that all quants must master.</li>
												<li>You can view our Competition Engineer Journal report here: <a href= "Website/Copy of Engineering Notebook.pdf"target="_blank">[link]</a></li>
											</ul>
									<li><b> MIT Zero Robotics Competition</b></li>
									<div class="image right"><img src="images/incapic.jpg" alt="" /></div>

											<ul>
												<li>This was an international coding competition that made me practice software development for specific scenarios regarding objects in space. To get an overview of this competition, please see my group’s <a href= "Website/Zero Robotics Game Manual.pdf"target="_blank">[Summarization of The Game Manual]</a>.  My competence in professional algorithmic coding assisted our team in placing in the top 120 teams internationally.
 </li>

											</ul>
									<li><b> Volunteer Projects</b></li>

											<ul>
												<li>My volunteer efforts have allowed me to obtain the National Presidential Volunteer Service Award for 250+ hours in a group setting. Representing the Cupertino Junior Optimist Octagon International Organization as Treasurer, I am always on the lookout for new ways to help my community. While managing the finances of this large-scale organization, I help promote local volunteer events to our 50+ members. Through personally volunteering at multiple day long marathons, wildlife reserves, and elderly homes, I have gained resilience that I can use to lead me through any project I take on as a quant. Also by helping facilitate successful large scale robotics regional tournaments and speech and debate competitions, I have gained great organizational skills.

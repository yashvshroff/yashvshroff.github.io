								<h1>Leadership<br /></h1>
								<p>The biggest area of growth that I have experienced during my high school years have been in my Leadership skills
								<br>
								I have held many leadership positions in FBLA, Boy Scouts, Medical Explorers including Competitions Officer, Community Service Project Chair, Senior Patrol Leader, Troop Guide, President, and many more. By leading my boy scouts crew in a 14-day backpacking trip through New Mexico to guiding and training 200+ CHS FBLA competitors at the Bay Section and State Leadership Conferences, I have been able to master the skills of communication, time management, and teamwork to help students, peers, and friends win awards and achieve success. Through the various leadership experiences, I have held throughout my school years, I have helped our school become a safe, friendly, and enriching environment.

							<h2> Boy Scouts: </h2>
							<div class="image right"><img src="images/phil.jpg" alt="" /></div>
							<p>
								Boy Scouts was the first place where I was given responsibility, as a Patrol Leader and eventually the Senior Patrol Leader. I was expected to organize and plan trips while maintaining the finances of the troop and keeping detailed records.  As Troop Instructor/Guide I taught first-aid, bicycling, fire safety, and helped other Scouts advance in rank.  I made my mistakes early; on my first hike as patrol leader I misoriented the map, leading us deep into the woods and far off the marked trail. But each mistake or accident was a learning experience, teaching me that determination to achieve perfection and a commitment to the task at hand will always lead to success. At the same time, I learned how to work in a team; as a patrol and as a troop we climbed peaks, backpacked many miles, and built our Eagle projects together. As an introvert, it was often difficult for me to lead others but dealing with a group of rambunctious peers, many older than me, day in and day out taught me how to make myself heard, and how to encourage others to follow my lead.

								Due to my commitment to Boy Scouts of Americal and Medical Explorers for the past 6 years, I was invited to represent Boy Scouts of America and the Exploring Program at the Silicon Valley Monterey Bay Council's 2019 Distinguished Citizen Dinner at Levis Stadium in San Francisco.

							<h2> Future Business Leaders of America </h2>
							<div class="image left"><img src="images/FBLA.JPG" alt="" /></div>
							<p>
								As the Community Relations Officer, I organized multiple guest speaker events, business tours, and a job shadow day for 300+ FBLA members. As the Chair of Community Service Project, Project HEAL, I led a group of 15 students in a service project to help the seniors in our community through volunteering events at Cupertino Health and Wellness Center. By organizing multiple arts, crafts and entertainment events that kept the residents engaged and excited over the next six months, I was able to spread a little joy and happiness amongst the senior citizens as well as help other student volunteers understand how enriching community service can be. As the Competitions Officer, I guided all the FBLA members to study and participate in regional, state, and national level conferences. Our training and efforts were paid off when many of our students won awards at the State and National competitions.

							<h2> Global Health Club </h2>
							<div class="image right"><img src="images/ph5.jpg" alt="" /></div>
							<p>
								After volunteering for the past two summers, I became a student leader for our school's Medical Mission trip to the Philippines, where we provide top-quality healthcare through mobile clinics to the underserved people in the rural villages. After hearing about the earthquake in the Philippines, before starting our mission, I organized a clothing and canned food drive at school. This not only helped to collect the necessary supplies but also helped to empower and engage my team members. From my previous trips, I had learnt that, prevalence of chronic diseases like diabetes, hypertension, and hyperlipidemia had skyrocketed in the Philippines . Unable to afford fresh fruits and vegetables, many Filipinos subsist on a diet very high in LDL cholesterol, sodium, and triglycerides. To combat these issues, I led my team in creating new programs that educate patients about creating lifestyle changes by eating a healthy diet and incorporating  exercise into their daily routine. We started Zumba sessions at each Barangay (village) and organized a 16k run that would also support our non-profit. Each of our successes came with its own share of challenges. I learned that leadership was not just planning, organizing, and speaking. It meant always being there for my team and providing them with the support that they needed to implement all these wonderful activities.

								As the Founder/President, I lead monthly meetings, invite guest speakers from different fields of medicine, organize shadowing opportunities, and plan visits to healthcare facilities. I also give presentations to motivate other students to pursue careers in medicine.
								Here is an excerpt from the Silicon Valley Monterey Bay Council’s Exploring Executive’s speech of recognition for achieving the Learning for Life Leadership Award
								“Yash has been a Medical Explorer with Post 777 and Post 911 from past three years. During  this time, he has held various leadership positions like the President, Vice-President of Programs, and Historian. He has worked hard to increase participation of the Post by organizing interesting guest speaker events, field trips and volunteering at Stanford blood center, Intuitive Surgicals, Cupertino Health and Wellness Center etc. When Post 777 was going to be dissolved due to various issues and lack of adult advisors, he worked hard to gather enough student members as well as adult advisors and started Post 911. In his current role as the President of Post 911, he hosts regular monthly meetings and provides numerous educational and networking opportunities to keep the explorers engaged and excited for the next meeting.” (Excerpt from the Silicon Valley Monterey Bay Council’s Exploring Executive’s letter of recognition for achieving the Learning for Life Leadership Award).

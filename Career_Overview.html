								<h2> Let's break down Computational Quantitative Analysis: </h2>
								<div class="image main"><img src="images/Overview.png" alt="" /></div>
								<h2> General Description of a Quant: </h2>
								<div class="image right"><img src="images/bullpic.jpg" alt="" /></div>
								<p>
									A quant, quantitative analyst, develops and implements complex mathematical models to come up with profitable investment strategies for hedge funds and other financial industries. A quant aims to reduce the risk of an investment and generate profits in a market, acting as both a logician and speculator. They use traditional statistical models, such as null hypotenuse testing,  to forecast market movements. They consistently develop hypotheses for how data sets affect investment assets and stocks. They also analyze the capacity of a data set, determining whether an investment plan should remain the same, or change, based on the current market. A quant can specialize in any of the following fields: Front Office, Back Office, Risk Management, Model Verification, and Algorithm Researcher. Quants are always competing against each other to be the first to find innovative ways to predict the market: ex. Use Satellite Imagery to look over the production of branded fruit farms and determine their market value through analyzing the abundance, health, and length of the crops from the satellite images.
 </p>
								<h2> Skills Required/Obstacles </h2>
								<p>A quantitative analyst is usually considered a jack-of-all-trades, as they need to specialize their skills in mathematics, computer science, business, and finance.
</p>
								<h3>Quants need to be Competent in various mathematical fields</h3>
<div class="image right"><img src="images/mathpic.jpg" alt="" /></div>
								<ul>
									<li>Differential and Stochastic Calculus</li>
									<li>Numerical Linear Algebra and Differential Equations </li>
									<li>Probability and Statistics</li>
									<li>Game Theory </li>
</ul>
								<h3>Quants need to understand different computer science languages and programs</h3>
								<ul>
									<li>Big Data modeling and Object Oriented programing</li>
									<li>Mathematical algorithm and model graphing languages: MatLab and SAS </li>
									<li>Machine Learning and Data Mining utilizing Python Programming and C++</li>
									<li>Ability to innovate prediction and classification computer programs and algorithms</li>
									</ul>
									<h3>Quants require keen business management skills</h3>
									<ul>

										<li>Analytical Problem Solving to figure out unique financial situations</li>
										<li>Working under pressure to make spontaneous financial decisions </li>
										<li>Persistence to work on very challenging projects without supervision</li>
										<li>Ability to Concentrate on computer code and data for long hours</li>
										</ul>
										<div class="image right"><img src="images/codepic.jpg" alt="" /></div>

									<h3>Quants require fundamental competence in Financial Practices</h3>
									<ul>

										<li>Ability to design appealing portfolios </li>
										<li>Plan portfolios utilizing equity and interest rate derivatives to their benefit</li>
										<li>Competence of both Systematic (manual) and Discretionary (rule-based) trading </li>
										<li>Ability to understand financial trends through financial models</li>
									</ul>
										<h3>Obstacles</h3>
									<p> A quant’s main obstacle is to maintain a healthy work environment. Finance jobs are infamous for gruesome working hours, including for quants who average 60-90 hour work weeks. As they compete to be the first to create innovative financial predictions, their work hours greatly increase. In addition, constantly staring at numbers to figure out data patterns and creating hundreds of mathematical models can be overwhelming. Successful quants must be able to efficiently work under this pressure.
</p>
									<h2> Education Requirements</h2>
									<div class="image left"><img src="images/edupic.jpg" alt="" /></div>

									<p>A quant starts their career off with an undergraduate degree at a reputable college in either Computer Science, Mathematics, Hardware/Electrical Engineering, or Theoretical Physics. After receiving an undergraduate degree in one of these disciplinaries, prospective quants pursue a masters and/or Ph.D. in Financial Engineering or FinTech. In addition to education through a relevant major, achieving a certificate in Chartered Financial Analysis (CFA) and Certificate in Quantitative Finance (CQF) is highly recommended. Although companies won’t require these certifications, quants with these certificates have an competitive edge over other prospective quants. Alongside education, a prospective quant should work in a professional environment through a financial analyst, software developer, or actuary internship.


<p> This is why I have applied, and have been accepted, into multiple colleges to pursue an undergraduate degree in the subjects recommended for quants. I also look to pursue a Ph.D. in FinTech to increase my skillset. While in school, I will simultaneously work on achieving both of the Quant Certificates as well as gaining more industry experience through internships.
 </p>
									<h2> Job Outlook </h2>
									<p>The U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) lumps quantitative analysis under the umbrella of financial analysis. They predict the field of financial analysis will grow by 14% from 2012 to 2022. However, CNN Money states that the outlooks for quants specifically is projected to be 41.2% over the next 10 years; as there is an accelerated growth of automated trading systems through hedge funds in the 21st century. Innovation in liquid securities and risk modeling has also opened more job opportunities in quantitative analysis. </p>
									<h2> Salary </h2>
									<div class="image right"><img src="images/nationalsalary.jpg" alt="" /></div>

									<p>
										Being in the realm of finance, a quantitative analyst makes a six-figure paycheck, and gains additional compensations, that sometimes are valued more than their annual salary. According to Glassdoor’s World Wide Salary Report, the national average salary for an entry-level quantitative analyst in the United States is $116,183, with an average cash compensation between $5,471 and $100,200. This range represents the entirety of USA, though, as salary ranges greatly differ by region. In San Jose, California, a base quant salary is about $148,616 with compensations as high as $120,000. In the economic capital of USA, New York City, New York, a base salary is $135,551, with compensation going up to $128,198. Because both California and New York are known as two of the most represented financial states in the USA, they have a high salary inflation. In Topeka, Kansas, a state not known for their financial prowess, a base quantitative analyst makes a mere $87,711, which is 25% below the USA average. The United Kingdom is the second best location for quants, as they host one of the largest financial capitals of the world, the London Square Mile. In the UK, the base salary for quants is £88,580, or $115,000.

								<p>Location for Masters/Ph.D. education is very important, as base salary varied depending on the school name. Rated by QuantNet, an average Financial Engineering degree from Princeton University leads to an average base salary of $120,000 (excluding compensation), while a degree from lesser ranked Claremont Graduate School receives an average base salary of $62,333.

								<p>This, however, is only the base salary for a quant. If a quant stays in a company for more than three years, their pay and compensation increase exponentially. Their salaries can go above $250,00 a year, including an annual compensation package of over $500,000. With experience, a quant also advances to the highest title: Senior Quantitative analyst.
</p>
									<h2> Advancement and Post Careers </h2>
									<div class="image left"><img src="images/wordlepic.jpg" alt="" /></div>

									<p>All quants start off as Quantitative Analysts, and work as a quant trader, quant researcher, or quant developer. Quantitative analysts start off working in back-office jobs, and can be promoted to a front-office job after showing clear financial talent. After working with a company for over 4 years, they can be promoted to a Senior Quantitative Analyst, the highest quantitative analyst position. The experience a Quantitative Analyst obtains through their work in both technical and business management is fundamental for any type of management, which is why it isn’t uncommon for quants to work in the field, and then move into a managerial role at another company. A quant can use their technical skills to go into software development, becoming a manager and Chief Technology Officer. They can also go through a financial path, becoming a hedge fund manager or a Chief Financial Officer for a company. Because of their jack-of-all-trades characteristics, they can even become entrepreneurs of their own business.</p>
